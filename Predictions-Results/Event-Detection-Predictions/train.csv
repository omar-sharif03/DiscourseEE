iv9cvq,Snorting suboxone to get off?. A friend of mine swears he got off subs by snorting them. He said it only works if it‚Äôs the subs with naloxone. His reasons seemed considerable. He said that he was able to quit after a month of snorting the 1/4 in the morning and 1/4 in the evening of the 8/2mg. Said when you snort the naloxone becomes active and so does the bupe. They kinda cancel each other out. You don‚Äôt feel bad but you don‚Äôt feel great and your body gets used to this. Almost like your not taking anything but not going into withdrawal. Has anyone else ever done this ? What are people‚Äôs thoughts ?,"Your friend may have successfully quit, but naloxone had nothing to do with it. I've snorted my subs plenty, and you get a higher bioavailability and catch a lil buzz, but the naloxone doesn't even apply.

Start with a super small dose of Subs like smaller than .5mg or 1/16 of a 8mg strip. Slowly increase the Subs daily. Once you are at 16mg per day on subs, you technically can't get high off of the blues so you will stop the blues at this point and then slowly taper off of the Subs.

C229,Smoking weed I know most clinics make you take a drug test to make sure you're actually taking it and not taking opioids. But what about weed? Does your clinic let you smoke weed whilst on suboxone? I've moved states and got different insurance but I found a love for delta 8 which will still pop for thc. Do you guys smoke? If so what does your doc/clinic say about it?,"I live in an illegal state and mine don't care if I smoke weed, as long as I don't use opioids.",['relapse']

M641,"Absorption question So I take two 2mg subs twice a day and the only thing I'm hating about suboxone so far is that it takes so long for the pill to disolve under my tongue, like 30 minutes or more.

us06qg,"Skipping days rather than cutting pills. After being prescribed 2mg tabs daily, I let my doc know that I thought the dose was too high. He told me to cut the pills, which is not that easy. I know i can make powder piles that are measured out, but instead of measuring out tiny piles, would it work take 1mg every other day, for example, for an average of .5 per day? My opi tolerance is (apparently) fairly low and I don't get sick when skipping time, I just get extremely depressed and anxious if I take \*too\* long off.","Yes , is the answer to your question. The Skipping Days Method is designed to lower your tolerance. I would still lower the amount also, imo 1mg is still a very high dose. I just haven't heard of anyone using this method at a relatively high dose and then jump off at some point in the method. Vs. doing both,, lowering the dosage And implement the Skipping Days Method. Smoother jump imo.",['taking-moud']
M_P_T20,Opioid detox in rehabs? What do you they do for there? Has anyone went away to a rehab for 2weeks- 1month for opiate dependency? What did they do to detox you. Did they taper you with subs for a week or two and you got off the subs before you left. Did you feel fine physically when you were done with the program. Or did you withdrawal from the suboxone afterwards when you left,I was drug tested for the first few days until I had no fentanyl in my system and then they gave me a medicine called Subutex and tapered me off that and then then started the suboxone for maintenance,"['tapering', 'taking-moud']"

M1095,A question for people who used to be on methadone and are now on suboxone. I was wondering if people on suboxone need/want to take their dose first thing in the morning like a lot of methadone patients (like myself) do. Like I find that I pretty much need to take my dose every 22-24h otherwise I start feeling the beginnings of discomfort seeping in. I was just wondering if suboxone is more forgiving in that way.,I get pretty decent discomfort going half the waking day without taking a suboxone dose. But that's because like a dumass I've always dosed multiple times a day leading to heavy addiction. I cant go for more than about 6 hours without dosing my subs,['taking-moud']
bdtffn,"Proper dosing. I take the pill form of Suboxone. Here is how I take it and let me know if I'm doing anything wrong. I place the tablet under my tongue. Sometimes I hold the tablet in place with my tongue. As your mouth fills with saliva the pill tends to want to ""float"" from under your tongue. That's why I hold it in place. After the pill is completely dissolved I do not swallow for around 10 minutes. Am I doing this right? Is there an easier way with a tablet? It takes about 20 to 30 minutes for me to dose.",Some people at my clinic use a crusher. Dissipates faster.,['taking-moud']

I have been sleeping bad since i started on suboxone, mostly due to withdrawals and the transition from poppy pod tea to suboxone. Last night i finally had a good nights sleep I have ben very tired. I hope and think it might be all the changes i am going through and not the suboxone. Is feeling tired a initial side effect of suboxone?",I‚Äôd definitely go down as fast as you can. That‚Äôs an extremely high dose. Especially for only being on poppy seeds. I was on 300+ mgs a day of oxy before switching to subs and 16 mgs did me well. I‚Äôm at 12 now though.

C_M597,Suboxone and oxycodone for pain??? My mums been prescribed suboxone strips and 'as needed' oxycodones for her IBS and back pain. Is it just me or is that insane??? Why would a pain management doctor prescribe something with naloxone in it for pain?? Someone either tell me I'm wrong to be very concerned that she's being prescribed suboxone and an opiate for pain or tell me I'm right to be flipping out that they're giving her opioid agonists and an antagonist for some reason.,"The naloxone is irrelevant and does nothing.

qouk2d,"If I'm in 24 mg of subs daily and stop cold turkey, how long until withdrawal hits?. Not only that, how bad will it be?","In my experience it's been 3-5 days or until you're in full withdrawal. The only thing I want to make very clear though is that if you're taking fentanyl or fentanyl laced drugs, you're in trouble. If you take fentanyl for long enough it will stay in your system for like 10+ days. I've gone through precipitated withdrawals multiple times because of this. Also if you do end up taking subs too soon and you go through the withdrawals, I would recommend just fight through it. It should only last a few days and then the subs will do their job.
