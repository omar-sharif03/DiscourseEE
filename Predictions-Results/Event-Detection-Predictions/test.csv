dvq9he,"Anyone wake up like this every morning?. Ihave severe bouts of butterflies, or anxiety, crippling me every single morning, this lasts till about an hour after my dose, its very very weird, and is driving me mad. Treatments???","Yeah the w'ds in the mornings definitely come as you taper. I find its usually the worst around the 20-24hr mark, right before you take the next dose. You could maybe try timing your dose a bit later, so you dont wake you with withdrawals.

q4n28n,Reducing my use. Hi I’m current on 4mg (2mg twice daily) and keen to keep reducing. My problem is that I’m only able to get 8mg tablets. How do I spilt these tablets accurately considering they crumble very easily?,"Either crush it into a powder and get a 0.001g scale (a 1mg scale +/- about 5 if you're weighing at least 100mg), or make a volumetric solution. Volumetric dosing is easier via nasal/rectal use, but if it's concentrated enough normal sublingual use should work too. I'm at 5mg/day subbed (or 2.8mg/day snorted/plugged) and have been dropping down by 0.1mg every 3-4 days.",['taking-moud']

iv9cvq,Snorting suboxone to get off?. A friend of mine swears he got off subs by snorting them. He said it only works if it’s the subs with naloxone. His reasons seemed considerable. He said that he was able to quit after a month of snorting the 1/4 in the morning and 1/4 in the evening of the 8/2mg. Said when you snort the naloxone becomes active and so does the bupe. They kinda cancel each other out. You don’t feel bad but you don’t feel great and your body gets used to this. Almost like your not taking anything but not going into withdrawal. Has anyone else ever done this ? What are people’s thoughts ?,"Your friend may have successfully quit, but naloxone had nothing to do with it. I've snorted my subs plenty, and you get a higher bioavailability and catch a lil buzz, but the naloxone doesn't even apply. I think this may be a good way to taper when you get down below 0.5mg a day, but using 4mg intranasal is gonna cause some problems down the road. For one, sub is super acidic. Another issue is all that gummy junk in your sinuses.",['tapering']

Start with a super small dose of Subs like smaller than .5mg or 1/16 of a 8mg strip. Slowly increase the Subs daily. Once you are at 16mg per day on subs, you technically can't get high off of the blues so you will stop the blues at this point and then slowly taper off of the Subs.

tiwpt0,Post Acute Withdrawal with suboxone after tramadol?. So I see a lot of conflicting information about if tramadol will work when you’re on suboxone. I have tooth infection and the tooth needs to be extracted (probably as a result from 15 years of suboxone). My dentist prescribed me tramadol and I’m wondering if I need to wait a certain about of time to take the suboxone after the tramadol.

So ive been off fent for 26 hours, and took my last 15 mg about an hour ago. when should i start to take subs?","That's kinda a tricky one imo. If you have only been off the 8MG for 5 days ,you still would have bupe in your system. You may have an easier time switching back. But tbh I would wait till I was feeling pretty shitty at LEAST another 24 hours. Taking those 4/15mg pills just delayed your induction imo.

Since I detoxed I realized a few things. 1. My suboxone and my vyvanse make me a zombie. I enjoy nothing. 2. I want to combat depression and CFS (chronic fatigue) naturally. So I’ve been back on my subs for maybe 2 1/2 weeks, same with vyvanse. Is that enough time for my body to be dependent again? I want off this shit.","The subs are just putting off physical WD so yes you are dependent the same as if you took another opioid, like H/fentadope, to relieve symptoms. Except WD from subs is longer and less intense.",['taking-moud']
