I am trying to get back off of the oxy and just take the subs but they're not working at all. All of my normal withdrawal symptoms are still present even after taking my full dose of 22mg for the day.

I'm scared to reach out to my doctor because I fear he will drop me.", "text2": "Going to subs from fentanyl/fentanyl analogues can be trickier than with regular opioids.
