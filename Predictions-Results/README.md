## üóÇÔ∏è Folder Description
* The `Argument-Extraction-Predictions` folder contains predictions of the models for the `Argument Extraction` task.
* The `Event-Detection-Predictions` folder contains predictions of the models for the `Event Detection` task.
* The `Argument-Extraction-Results` folder contains the results for each role, argument type, and event.

Reproducing the predictions for many of our models is very expensive. Therefore all released all the predictions for both event detection and argument extraction tasks.

‚ùó **Note:** In this notebook, you will see 'main arguments' and 'event-specific arguments', which indicate the 'core arguments' and 'type-specific arguments' of the main paper.
